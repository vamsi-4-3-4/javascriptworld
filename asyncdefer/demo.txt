To add javascript to the html document we use the script tag.

We place our script tag at the head or the body section.

Most of the developers will place the script tag in the body.

The reason for that is to use any element in the javascript the document should me leaded first.

We can add our script in head section and we should not wait until the document is laoded.


to do this we will use the two options

1.defer
2.async

when we use defer browser will load all the html first and notice for java script calls and then execute js at the end.
